	  This paragraph is properly wrapped. Since a tab counts as 8
	  spaces and the help text must be wrapped at column 72, only 62
	  characters for the text itself are expect per line.


	  Another paragraph. - But this time we cross the column 72 by 1.

	  http://www.example.com/ urls do not have spaces and this line is too long.
